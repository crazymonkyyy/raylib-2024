### Examples

examples are surprizinly in the examples folder, this is the expected output and some explaination of what I expect it to show

## [helloworld](../examples/001-helloworld.d)

![](helloworld.png)

Drawing text, some random syntax for my string type, and colors; messy rn

## [drawtest](../examples/002-drawtest.d)

![](drawtest.png)

the api I had in mind depends on named arguments working with templates; they dont,
waiting on if that changes before making a complicated workaround

## [buttons and messages](../examples/003-buttons-and-messages.d)

(interactive but boring skiping image)

status and button syntax, read the damn code and trust

## [debuging](../examples/004-debuging.d)

(interactive but boring skiping image)

using "watch" to add a varible to the debug menu on F2

## [missle command](../examples/005-misslecommand.d)

![](missle.gif)
