I grow ever more convinced that end users are asoundingly incompident and no ammount of any improvment in communication skills will make me paletable to empoyelers or users. Seccuss in a the morden world is fickle, stupid and skin deep; so im going to fucking join them, with wasm so I can ship gui code to even the most use(less)rs

I want a 1 hour turn around time of first draft of an idea to github hosted link of a wasm app; sane cli apps, mantainable expandable code thru templates, preformence; NO; we tech wizards I make flashy lights held up by ducktape and the end users go "wow", the more ducktape, the more vapid lights, THE MORE BETTER

100 line day long projects, to slow; 20-30 lines in 3 hours and then 8 hours of self promotion, get out that cocaine.

That one based romence author accepting a reward saying the way he wrote women was "to write a man, then remove all sense of responablity"; I aim to treat end users like children who can be entertained with 3 lines of code hacks. 

*I want a pretty "app" doing something useless every 30 lines.*
